### 4.1 Save Catalog

---

This feature allows you to create catalogs and deploy multiple desired servers at once. If a server container image is a build, only the image is saved and converted into a common image to be saved as a catalog. A saved catalog can be found in the service catalog.

When saving a catalog, config maps and secrets are also saved in the template. **\(Secret values are not saved for security reasons.\)**
